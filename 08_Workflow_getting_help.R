##### 8  Workflow: getting help #####


##### 8.1 Google is your friend #####

# (If the error message isn’t in English, run 
# Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "en") 
# and re-run the code; you’re more likely to find help for English 
# error messages.)

# If Google doesn’t help, try Stack Overflow. Start by spending a little time 
# searching for an existing answer, including [R], to restrict your search to 
# questions and answers that use R.


##### 8.2 Making a reprex #####

# If your googling doesn’t find anything useful, it’s a really good idea to 
# prepare a reprex, short for minimal reproducible example. A good reprex makes it 
# easier for other people to help you, and often you’ll figure out the problem 
# yourself in the course of making it. There are two parts to creating a reprex:

  # - First, you need to make your code reproducible. This means that you need to 
  #   capture everything, i.e. include any library() calls and create all necessary 
  #   objects. The easiest way to make sure you’ve done this is using the reprex 
  #   package.

  # - Second, you need to make it minimal. Strip away everything that is not directly 
  #   related to your problem. This usually involves creating a much smaller and 
  #   simpler R object than the one you’re facing in real life or even using 
  #   built-in data.

# That sounds like a lot of work! And it can be, but it has a great payoff:

  # - 80% of the time, creating an excellent reprex reveals the source of your problem. 
  #   It’s amazing how often the process of writing up a self-contained and minimal 
  #   example allows you to answer your own question.

  # - The other 20% of the time, you will have captured the essence of your problem 
  #   in a way that is easy for others to play with. This substantially improves your 
  #   chances of getting help!
